we type the name of the person we want to talk to in the search field, click on it, start a conversation with them and send them our first message (I've logged in with a different account and added the view from that account).

I added a feature called heart messages, similar to the starred messages feature in whatsapp. so as we change the switch button, we make changes to the record in the database. when we press the icon with three dots in the upper right corner, we see the heart messages we have saved. (video call and add contact buttons do not work. i added it only for display.)

I'm attaching a screenshot of me sending a message from another account to show that chatting is possible.
